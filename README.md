# HoverMonke
This mod essentially allows you to hover, and fly, in a modded lobby. Feel free to use the source code! This was made with Graicc's template. This requires the latest version of utilla, and make sure to sub to my modding channel, or my main channel!

How to install: Install ZIP file located below, then extract it, and put the folder in you Gorilla tag plugins. One then, launch your game, go into a modded lobby, and jump, then click "A" or "X" on your oculus controller. If it doesn't work, DM me. My discord in @yamahagorillatag
